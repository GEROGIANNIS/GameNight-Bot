GameNight Bot

GameNight Bot is designed to organize nightly game sessions within a Discord server.
Each night, the bot announces a random game for the community to play, opening a dedicated voice channel for participants to join at midnight.
This encourages regular gaming sessions, community bonding, and interactive fun.
